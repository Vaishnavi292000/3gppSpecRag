      "\n",
      "### eDRX with Call Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "#### What is eDRX?\n",
      "- eDRX (Extended Discontinuous Reception) is a power-saving feature designed for IoT (Internet of Things) devices in LTE/4G networks. It allows devices to \"sleep\" for extended periods, reducing battery consumption by not listening for downlink data as frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Network Elements\n",
      "- **UE (User Equipment)**: The device (e.g., IoT sensor).\n",
      "- **MME (Mobility Management Entity)**: Controls signaling and session management in LTE.\n",
      "- **HSS (Home Subscriber Server)**: Stores subscriber data, including eDRX configuration.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### The Call Flow: How eDRX is Exchanged\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial Attach/Connection**\n",
      "   - The **UE** initiates a connection to the LTE network via radio access (E-UTRAN).\n",
      "   - The **MME** receives the Attach Request from the UE.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Update Location Request (ULR)**\n",
      "   - The **MME** sends an **Update Location Request (ULR)** message to the **HSS** over the S6a interface.\n",
      "   - The **ULR** includes information such as the subscriber's IMSI and the **RAT-Type** (Radio Access Technology, e.g., EUTRAN for LTE).\n",
      "   - **Note:** The ULR does **not** carry eDRX values from the MME.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **HSS Determines eDRX Configuration**\n",
      "   - The **HSS** checks the subscriber's profile for eDRX configuration.\n",
      "   - If there are multiple possible eDRX values for a given service (e.g., DATA_4G), the HSS selects the most appropriate or preferred eDRX-Cycle-Length based on its internal logic and the RAT-Type received.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Update Location Answer (ULA)**\n",
      "   - The **HSS** responds to the MME with an **Update Location Answer (ULA)**.\n",
      "   - The ULA includes the **eDRX-Cycle-Length** value(s) in a specific AVP (Attribute Value Pair).\n",
      "   - Only **one** eDRX cycle length is sent per RAT-Type (e.g., one for EUTRAN, one for NB-IoT, etc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **MME Applies eDRX Configuration**\n",
      "   - The **MME** uses the eDRX value received from the HSS to configure the UE's eDRX cycle as part of the session setup.\n",
      "   - The MME may pass this to the eNodeB or directly to the UE, depending on the procedure.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Summary Table\n",
      "\n",
      "| Step         | Message         | Direction        | eDRX Info?              |\n",
      "|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------|\n",
      "| 1. Attach    | Attach Request  | UE → MME         | No                      |\n",
      "| 2. ULR       | ULR (S6a)       | MME → HSS        | No                      |\n",
      "| 3. Selection | (Internal)      | HSS              | HSS selects eDRX config |\n",

      "| 5. Config    | Context Setup   | MME ↔ UE/eNB     | MME applies eDRX        |\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Important Notes\n",
      "- The eDRX configuration is **not** sent in the ULR, but only in the ULA from HSS to MME.\n",
      "- The HSS makes the selection of which eDRX cycle length to use if multiple are provisioned.\n",
      "- Only a **single** eDRX cycle length per RAT-Type is sent to the MME.\n",
      "- This process is part of the initial attach and session setup flow in LTE networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Use Case Example\n",
      "- An IoT device attaches to the network.\n",
      "- The MME queries the HSS for the subscriber's profile and eDRX settings.\n",
      "- The HSS sends back the appropriate eDRX configuration for 4G (EUTRAN) in the ULA.\n",
      "- The device is then configured to use this eDRX cycle, enabling it to save power by sleeping for longer intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**  \n",
      "In the LTE call flow, eDRX configuration is provisioned in the subscriber's profile on the HSS. During the attach, the MME requests the profile using a ULR, and the HSS responds with a ULA that includes the eDRX value. The MME\n",
