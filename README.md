# 3gppSpecRag
Power RAGers, a demo of RAG based AI, which takes sample input of 3gpp spec of few AVPs and its description. With the help of document &amp; trained model we get summary of user input.

# ðŸš€ 3GPP Spec Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) App

This is the **Demo of RAG implementation on the simple questions of 3GPP spec**.  
We built a simple chatbot using an LLM (gpt-4.1) to handle user asked questions.

This combines **document similarity search** with **LLM summarization**, letting you ask questions that get answered using your own internal documents.

ðŸŽ¯ **Use case:**  
1. Retrieve the most relevant content from uploaded document and trained model data
2. Summarize or directly answer your question using the retrieved context

By the end, youâ€™ll have a powerful mini assistant thatâ€™s grounded in your own documentation, perfect for accelerating engineering discovery and troubleshooting.
